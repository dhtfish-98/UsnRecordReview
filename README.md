# UsnRecordReview

New implementation author: **dhtfish98**. Current package version: **1.0.2**.

Detects incomplete change journal evidence and keeps unresolved v4 continuation evidence OPEN.

## Supported project scope

Extracted USN stream versions 2, 3 and 4: aligned record/page padding, bounded name offsets and UTF-16, signed nonnegative USNs, sequence ordering, v4 extent sizes/ranges and continuation declarations.

This repository implements that entire selected standalone scope. It does not claim that the original upstream platform has been rewritten in full.

## Use

```sh
python -m pip install .
usnrecordreview examples/valid.bin
```

Supply one local regular file. The file CLI requires OS `O_NOFOLLOW` and `O_NONBLOCK` support; missing safety flags return OPEN before opening the path. This file-reader contract was verified on macOS/Linux; native Windows file reading is outside the validated profile. No symlinks or automatic artifact discovery are accepted. The CLI prints JSON; exit 0 means supported checks completed, exit 1 means a structural failure, and exit 2 means unsupported/incomplete analysis. Each successful read includes the input SHA-256 and byte count. Paths, contents, report messages and identities are suppressed. The input is never modified.

## Explicit limits and boundaries

Input limit: 16 MiB. Record limit: 100,000. V4 extent entries also have a separate aggregate limit of 100,000 across the supplied stream. This is a bounded tool profile, not an NTFS format limit. Additional format-specific limits are enforced in the source.

Excluded capabilities: NTFS volume access, MFT resolution, deleted-record carving, path reconstruction and cause/tampering attribution.

PASS only describes the recorded checks. It does not prove real-world safety, historical activity, authenticity, applicant contribution or CVP approval. CVP application suitability/qualification remains OPEN until the applicant supplies the real authorized work, relevant restriction evidence and identity/organization facts.
